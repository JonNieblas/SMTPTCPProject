*Must support multiple clients

	-----------------------CLIENT---------------------------

*"Telnet <your server's ip address> <port>" can be used to test your smtp server program first
	*then test SMTP client with SMTP server
	*use Telnet as a client initially

1. SMTP Client Program (NOT a TELNET client!!!) (X)
	*display a message asking for host name of SMTP server (like before) (x)

2. Build up TCP connection to SMTP server with Host Name input by User at given port.(X)
	* Catch the exception & display error / terminate program if invalid host name (x)
	* Wait for, read, and display the "220" response from the SMTP server (x)

3. Display prompt messages to ask the user to input (respectively): (X)
	* Sender's email address (x)
	* Receiver's email address (x)
	* Subject (x)
	* Email contents (body of the email) (x)
	    * Consider a do-while that ends when line = "." (x)
		* Contents must end with a "." on a single line (ending signature) (x)
		* Give the user this info via stndrd output (x)

4. Use user inputs collected in step 3 for the following 3 phase data transfer procedure. (X)
*DISPLAY RTT OF EACH STEP BELOW RESPECTIVELY (x)
* wait for SMTP response for each & display before moving to the next. (x)
	a. Send the "HELO <sender's mail server domain name>" command to SMTP server program(x)
	b. Send the "MAIL FROM: <sender's email address>" command to SMTP server (x)
	c. Send the "RCPT TO: <receiver's email address>" command to the SMTP server program (x)
	d. Send the "DATA" command to the SMTP server program, wait for SMTP server's response and display it
		on the standard output. (x)
	e. Send the Mail message to the SMTP server (x)
		* the format of Mail message MUST follow format detailed on slide titled "Mail message format" (x)
		* wait for SMTP server response & display

5. Display a prompt message to ask the User whether to continue. If yes, repeat steps 3 through 5.(X)
	* Otherwise, send a "QUIT" command to the SMTP server(x)
	* Display SMTP Server's response(x)
	* close TCP connection(x)
	* terminate the client program(x)


	-----------------------SERVER---------------------------

1. Listen to the given port and wait for a connection request from a SMTP Client(X)

2. Create a new thread for every incoming TCP connection request from SMTP(X)
	* Send the "220" response including server's ip address or dns name to the SMTP client(X)

3. Implement the following 3-phase data transfer procedure (see step 4 on client side):
	a. Wait for, read, and display the "HELO" command from SMTP client (x)
		* If the incoming command is NOT HELO (x)
			* sends "503 5.5.2 Send hello first" response to the SMTP client and repeat step 3. a. (x)
	b. Send the "250 <server's ip> Hello <client's ip>" response to the SMTP client. (x)
	c. Wait for, read, and display the "MAIL FROM" command from the SMTP client. (x)
		* If incoming command is NOT "MAIL FROM" (x)
			* sends "503 5.5.2 Need mail command" to client & repeat 3. c. (x)
	d. Send the "250 2.1.0 Sender OK" response to SMTP client. (x)
	e. Wait for, read, and display the "RCPT TO" command from the SMTP client. (x)
		* If incoming command is NOT "RCPT TO" (x)
			* sends "503 5.5.2 Need rcpt command" to client & repeat 3. e. (x)
	f. Send the "350 2.1.5 Recipient OK" response to SMTP client (x)
	g. Wait for, read and display the "DATA" command from SMTP client (x)
		* If incoming command is NOT "DATA" (x)
			* send "503 5.5.2 Need data command" & repeat 3. g. (x)
	h. Send the "354 Start mail input; end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>" response to the client (x)
	i. Wait for, read * display the mail message from the SMTP client line by line. (hint: "." is ending sign)(x)
	j. Send the "250 Message received and to be delivered" response to the SMTP client

4. Repeat step 3 until "QUIT" command is read
	* Upon receiving "QUIT, send "221 <server's ip> closing connection" to client
	* Go to step 5

5. Close all i/o streams and teh TCP socket for THIS client, and terminate the thread for THIS client
